# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-ML-project

**Project Overview**
This project aims to classify sonar signals as reflecting off either rocks or mines using machine learning. The primary dataset consists of sonar signals that bounce off either a metal cylinder (mimicking mines) or various rocks. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify these sonar signals, aiding in the detection of underwater mines in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

**Key objectives:**

- Preprocess and analyze the sonar data.
- Train a machine learning model on the dataset.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as only accuracy score.
- Predict and classify sonar signals based on trained model performance.

**Dataset**

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Sonar dataset).
Description: This dataset contains 208 samples, each with 60 features representing sonar signal intensities at different frequencies.
Target Labels:
M: Signal reflects off a mine.
R: Signal reflects off a rock.

**Attributes:**
- 60 numeric values representing sonar signal frequencies.
- Label: "R" for rock and "M" for mine.

**Project Steps**

1.Data Preprocessing:

-Handled any missing or outlier data (if present).
-Normalized or scaled the feature values to improve model performance.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Visualized the feature distributions, correlations, and any patterns in sonar readings.
-Investigated class distribution to understand the balance between rock and mine signals.

3.Feature Engineering:

-Selected the most relevant features using feature importance or dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

4.Model Selection:

  Experimented with various classification algorithms including:
  -Logistic Regression
  -K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  -Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  -Random Forests
  -Neural Networks (if applicable)
  -Evaluated each model based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Model Training and Evaluation:

-Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
-Used cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
-Compared models and selected the one with the best performance metrics.

6.Deployment:

-Finalized the model with the best results and packaged it for deployment.
-Provided a sample prediction script to demonstrate how to use the model with new data.
